To play the game **"Codex: Code the World"**, follow these simple steps:

### 1. **Start the Game**
   - Load the game in your browser. You’ll be greeted with a welcome screen, an input area for code, and a "Submit Code" button.

### 2. **Read the Challenge**
   - Each challenge has a description on the main screen. For example:
     - "Fix the broken code to change the world."
   - This gives you a task to complete with your code.

### 3. **Write the Code**
   - In the provided text area (under "Enter your code"), write the JavaScript code to solve the challenge.
   - For example, to fix the first challenge, you might write:
     ```javascript
     console.log('World is balanced!');
     ```

### 4. **Submit Your Code**
   - After writing your code, click the "Submit Code" button to check if it’s correct.

### 5. **Get Feedback**
   - **Correct Code:** If your code is right, the game will give feedback like:
     - "Well done! You've restored balance!"
     - The world’s background changes (e.g., from dark to light, or broken to fixed).
   - **Incorrect Code:** If your code is wrong, you’ll see:
     - "Oops! That didn't work. Try again."
     - Modify your code and try again.

### 6. **Proceed to the Next Challenge**
   - Once you solve a challenge, the game will move to the next one, revealing new coding tasks.
   - The world continues to evolve based on your progress.

### 7. **Complete All Challenges**
   - Continue solving challenges until you’ve completed all levels.
   - Once all challenges are solved, the game will congratulate you for restoring balance to the world.

### Key Points:
- **Each challenge** has a specific solution, so match your code to solve it.
- **World changes** reflect your success, showing how your code affects the environment.
- Don’t worry if you don’t get it right the first time. You’ll get feedback to guide you.

Enjoy coding your way through the challenges!
